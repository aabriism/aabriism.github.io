# Meaning in Life

**You matter.  Your life has meaning.**

It is that simple.  You matter and your life has meaning.

Once you start to feel that, once you start to believe it, you may back-slide, you may question "but *why* do I matter"?

Now take it to the next level.  If you can start to believe this about you, then use your empathy.  Use Abriism's core values.  Look at others and realize "they matter".  Take it one step further - realize that they should be thinking about you that *you matter*.

This is where we find meaning:  in each other.  In realizing that each other matters.  In realizing that you matter.

If you want to have a full heart filled with meaning and accomplishment, look to helping others and your self.  Make things better.
