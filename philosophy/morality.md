# Right and Wrong

The Central Tenets leave aside morality for a reason.  *You can only be moral if you are a moral agent.*  As soon as you give up moral decisions to a central authority you are no longer capable of being moral.

The Central Belief enshrines this by asking the believer to engage with and define *better*.  The Central Practice encourages discussion to help the believer define "better" if they are ever in doubt.

Being a moral agent and understanding the origin of morality is not hard.  We all have a sense of fairness, of right, and of wrong.  Those of us raised with love have maintained it.

It comes from a sense of personal pain and joy, a sense of empathy for others, and the application of rationality to apply it impartially and consistently.
