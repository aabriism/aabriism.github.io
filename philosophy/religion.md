# Religion

Religion across cultures and through time is so broad that it cannot be spoken of easily in a single page.

So let me instead say this about *some* people's practice of *some* religions.  **If people in your religion do not behave like this, then it does not apply to you.  But if you share a religion with somebody who does behave like this, perhaps you can help make it better.**


### Abusing Meaning in the Name of Religion
If you ever find yourself being pressured to believe a religion because (they say) "your life has no meaning without religion",
you should know that they are wrong.  If you are a child and an adult is saying this to you, you should know that they are abusing you, and that
as an adult they should know better.

Some people who have been consistently subjected to this behaviour eventually claim that "religion was a life-preserver thrown to them 
that gave meaning to an otherwise empty life".   What I have seen is certain religious people consistently trying to push a child's head under water
to make them want the life preserver.  What I have seen is certain religious people consistently trying to hollow the meaning out of a child's life
so they could fill it.

If you are a person who does this in the name of your religion, I suggest at the very least you reconsider your abuse of children.

### Abuse of Moral Authority
If you ever find yourself being encouraged, in the name of religion, to accept something as moral that you believe is not moral, or to accept something as immoral that you believe is moral, then you are being subject to abuse of moral authority.  

One of the worst things a religion can do is remove moral agency from people.  This is why morality and the definition of good and evil is not in the central tenets of Aabriism.  By removing moral authority from people, you create situations in which the most horrible things imaginable happen.

The only way to be moral is to reject all moral authorities and to take responsibility for your own morality.

## Aabriism

Aabriism is itself a religion and its Central Belief encourages moral agency.  Its first discussion encourages everyone to believe their life has meaning.

Some atheists may balk at having a religion because word "religion" has been so strongly associated with horrible actions and nonsensical thoughts promoted in the name of religion.  Yet Aabriism is a religion.  Perhaps in some small way this could help soften the view towards religion and separate  criticism of religion from  criticism of the actions taken by a church or it's adherents.
