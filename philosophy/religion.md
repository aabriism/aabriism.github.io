# Religion

Relgion through current cultures and through time is so broad that it cannot be spoken of easily in a single page.

So let me instead say this about *some* relgions.

If you ever find yourself being pressured to beleive a relgion because (they say) "your life has no meaning without relgion",
you should know that they are wrong.  If you are a child and an adult is saying this to you, you should know that they are abusing you, and that
as an adult they should know better.

Some people who have been conistently subjected to this eventually find that religion is a life-preserver thrown to them 
that gives meaning to an otherwise empty life.   What I have seen is religious people consistently trying to push a child's head under water
to make them want the life preserver.  What I have seen is religious people consistently trying to empty meaning out of a child's life
so they could fill it.

If you are part of a religion with those characteristics, I suggest at the very least you reconsider your abuse of children.
