# Religion

Religion across cultures and through time is so broad that it cannot be spoken of easily in a single page.

So let me instead say this about *some* people's practice of *some* religions.  **If people in your religion do not behave like this, then it does not apply to you.  But if you share a religion with somebody who does behave like this, perhaps you can help make it better.**

If you ever find yourself being pressured to believe a religion because (they say) "your life has no meaning without religion",
you should know that they are wrong.  If you are a child and an adult is saying this to you, you should know that they are abusing you, and that
as an adult they should know better.

Some people who have been consistently subjected to this behaviour eventually claim that "religion was a life-preserver thrown to them 
that gave meaning to an otherwise empty life".   What I have seen is certain religious people consistently trying to push a child's head under water
to make them want the life preserver.  What I have seen is certain religious people consistently trying to hollow the meaning out of a child's life
so they could fill it.

If you are a person who does this in the name of your religion, I suggest at the very least you reconsider your abuse of children.
