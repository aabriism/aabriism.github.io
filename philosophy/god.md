# God

The central tenets make no mention of God for a reason.  Aabriism is fundamentally atheist: a-theist.  
This does not mean Aabriism opposes god, it means that god is such a poorly defined and personally variable concept
that it has little utility for our religion.

You may believe that Aussie rules football is better than American football, you may believe in an omipotent God, or you 
may believe that you made the perfect cup of tea last Wednesday.  All of these things have nothing to do with Aabriism and you
can be an Aabriist if you want.
