# Welcome to Aabriism

Aabriism (pronounced Abri - ism) is a religion for atheists created by an atheist.  As such, it has no concept of a god or gods.  It is not unique in this as there are other religions that have no need for gods.  It is not special and no-one will care if you just ignore it, but if it resonates with you, fork the repo and add discussions.  (Someday I'll figure out a model for contribution that doesn't require forking.)

## Central Tenets
The Central Belief, Central Values, and Central Practices are Central Tenets common to all forms of Aabriism. 

### Central Belief
As an atheist who wanted to better understand belief, I asked my self "is there anything I would hope to believe even in the face of contradictory evidence?".  
What began as an exercise in understanding faith became, to my surprise, a foundational belief.

  **I can make it better.**

That is the central belief of Aabriism.  **I can make it better.**  It is a belief that takes a bit of work to understand.  What is *it*?  What is *better*?  What can *I do*? 
It is applied in different ways in different circumstances.  Most importantly, it is something that I hope to be able to believe always - even in the face of contradictory evidence.  I hope that even when it appears most bleak, that I can hold this belief and find a creative way to answer these questions - find a way to make something, in some small way, better.

### Central Values
There are two central values in Aabriism, summed up in the observation: "we are Animals Attempting to Behave RatIonally".  Aabriists recognize and value these two sides to people:  
* We are animals. 
  * We are irrational, emotional, complex, beings.
* We attempt to be rational
  * Some of our greatest achievments have arisen from rationality - from an attempt to grow beyond our animal limitations and to apply logic, mathematics, scientific rigor, precedent and balance.

**We value the emotional and the rational in people.**  We do not sacrifice one for the other.  We do not require people to be rational to be atheists, but we do not accept all forms of irrationality as desirable within an individual or a society.

### Central Practices
There are two central practices in Aabriism.

First:   We practice *Discussion within the Scope of the Central Tenets*. 

To enrichen the experience of being an Aabriist, and to help each other.  Everyone can contribute and everyone can choose their own wisdom from among the discussions.

Second: *Don't give money to anybody who claims to be collecting it on behalf of Aabriism.*

We've seen this too many times with religions.  Just don't do it.  If an aabriist group wishes to promote a particular project to "make something better", then they may request donations for that project, and if you are considering giving, you must decide based purely upon the merits of the project.  You should never, ever, give money to somebody who claims to be a representative of Aabrism for need it for the good of Aabriism.


## Discussions
The discussions are ways of extending Aabriism, opening up questions, answering some, and introducing new practices.  They are not canon for the religion, but hopefully they are useful and participating in creating them is enjoyable.  At present, participate by forking this repo and making merge requests.

## Why?
After years of thinking about this and then trying to live by it, I am the only adherent I know.  My sons toy with it in varying degrees, but I don't think they would be comfortable saying "I am an Aabriist" partly because it is just a weird thing to do - to have your own religion.  Yet they have had many discussions with their friends about concepts in these pages, and about Aabriism.  In the end, I have created these pages for myself, for my sons, and to entertain their friends with the dottiness of a sincere old man.
