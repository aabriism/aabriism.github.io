# Welcome to Aabriism

Aabriism is a religion for atheists created by an atheist.  As such, it has no concept of a god or gods.  It is not unique in this as there are other religions that have no need for gods.  It is not special and you no-one will care if you just ignore it.  But if it resonates with you, you may decide to practice it.

## Central Belief
As an atheist who wanted to better understand belief, I asked my self "is there anything I would hope to believe in even in the face of contradictory evidence?".  
What began as an exercise in understanding faith became, to my surprise, a foundational belief.

  I can make it better.

That is the central belief of Aabriism.  **I can make it better.**  It is a belief that takes a bit of work to understand.  What is *it*?  What is *better*?  What can *I do*? 
It is applied in different ways in different circumstances.  Most importantly, it is something that I hope to be able to believe always - even in the face of contradictory evidence.  I hope that even when it appears most bleak, that I can hold this belief and find a creative way to answer these questions - find a way to make something, in some small way, better.

## Central Values
There are two central values in Aabriism, summed up in the observation: "we are Animals Attempting to Behave RatIonally".  Aabriists recognize and value these two sides to people:  
* we are animals.  We are irrational, emotional, complex, beings.
* some of our greatest achievments have arisen from rationality - from an attempt to grow beyond our animal limitations and to apply logic, mathematics, scientific rigor, precedent and balance.

We value the emotional and the rational.  We do not sacrifice one for the other.  We do not require people to be rational to be atheists, and we do not accept all forms of irrationality as being compatible or desirable within an individual or a society.
