# Observances

## Holidays

There are no set holidays for Aabriism, but the only thing that really makes sense to me is to have them on the soltices and equinoxes.  I have been trying to bring myself to structure this, but have not been very observant:
* spring equinox
  * ask yourself "what can I do for the world, for the natural environment to make it better?"
* summer solstice
  * ask yourself "what can I do for myself, to make me better?"
* fall equinox
  * ask yourself "what can I do for my family, to help them?"
* winter solstice
  * ask yourself "what can I do for my community, to help them - to make it better?
