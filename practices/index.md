# Observances

Once during a thanksgiving holiday dinner with family over, I said grace.  I said something along the lines of "I am grateful everyone is here and I hope that when times are challenging we can each believe that we have the power to make it a little bit better".  My brother-in-law, a notoriously cynical and negative person, then took it upon himself to belittle my grace.  I had a brief moment of reflection and decided that the best thing I could do was to let it pass and move the conversation along.  Perhaps later, I could address it again as forcefully as I wanted to in the moment.  There were two observances during that meal:  one during grace, one immediately after.

# Holidays

There are no set holidays for Aabriism, but the only thing that really makes sense to me is to have them on the soltices and equinoxes.  I have been trying to bring myself to structure this, but have not been very observant:
* spring equinox
  * ask yourself "what can I do for the world, for the natural environment to make it better?"
* summer solstice
  * ask yourself "what can I do for myself, to make me better?"
* fall equinox
  * ask yourself "what can I do for my family, to help them?"
* winter solstice
  * ask yourself "what can I do for my community, to help them - to make it better?
