# Conflict Between Theists and Atheists

I would like to have a truly atheist religion, but conflicts with theists often arise and must be addressed.

Sometimes the conflicts are started by atheists, sometimes they are started by theists.  Here are some thoughts.

## Strawmen

Both sides are guilty of creating strawmen of the other side.  Just stop it.  If you observe something the other side does, absolutely 
comment on it, but be careful of generalizing too much or creating a strawman that only inflames.

If somebody does create a strawman, absolutely point it out - but try to educate and assume a kind audience and let them prove otherwise.

There are bad Christians, bad Muslims, bad Atheists.  The rest of us are tired of being associated with the worst of us.  Try not to do it.

## Power

Neither atheists nor theists worry about children's belief in Santa Claus.  We know it is not true, we know that they will outgrow it, and 
we know that they are not in positions of power where they can pass laws punishing people on the naughty list or starting wars over the elves's names.

Beliefs that drive political and military power are dangerous - when beliefs are being used to oppress people or destroy the world, 
then the belief becomes part of the conversation.  Our challenge is to focus just on the part of the belief that is driving the oppression 
and to keep it in the context of oppression.   Absolutely we must challenge destructive actions.

## The Need for Truth

Without a common understanding of truth and reality, we are lost.  Justice is impossible.  Rational decisions making is impossible.  There is 
a deep epistemological tangent I could take here, but briefly:  truth is real, truth is approximate, and some things are more true than others.

We cannot as a society let slip our understanding of truth.  People of faith must be included in this.  They, just like the rest of us, must understand the nature of truth
for our society to prosper.  We cannot let habits like "I believe it so it is true" promulgate.  However, atheists attacking theists on this doesn't help change anybody's mind.
We need to help the theist support the contradiction - to believe something and at the same time acknowledge it is not true.
