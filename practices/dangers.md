# The Dangers of Aabriism

Here are the dangers that I can see.

## It's not the Secret
No, you can't do whatever you want - you can't arbitrarily decide that "it" is war and "make better" is "end all wars forever".  Get a grip.  

Also, don't let people who hear about Aabriism construct this strawman against it.  Tell them that it is about agency not magic.  If they persist, tell them to f right off until they grow up and then keep f'ing right off.

## It's not an Obligation
Don't believe you *have to* make everything better.  Go easy on yourself.  

The point of the central belief is to give you agency, hope and meaning, not to give you an obligation.  It is enough to live a simple life where you do no harm, but if you find that you are unhappy, please know that there is something you can do about it.  You can make it better.

## It doesn't mean you're good
Not everyone who is Aabriist is good.  The central tenets do not try to tell you what is good or evil.  That is left to personal agency guided by discussion. There will be bad people who will twist the word "better".  Always judge the morality of a person separately from their stated religion.
