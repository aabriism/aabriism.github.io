# The Dangers of Aabriism

There are two main dangers that I can see.

First:  Don't beleive you *have to* make everything better.  Go easy on yourself.  The point of the 
central belief is to give you hope and meaning, not to give you an obligation.  It is enough to live
a simple life where you do no harm, but if you find that you are unhappy, please know that there is something you can do about it.  You can make it better.

Second:  Not everyone who is Aabriist is good.  The central tenants do not try to tell you what is good or evil.  That is left to the discussions.  
There will be bad people who will twist the word "better".  Always judge morality by your own core.
