# Iconography and Music

One of the most lovely things about religion is that the community shares icongraphy and music.  I hope that one day, if there are any followers of Aabriism, that we have some.

The one thing I can see quite clearly in my mind is a picture.  It is a night scene.  There is a large abri (an angled stone cliff face in this case), with a shelter built up next to it.  There is a fire in front of the shelter and people sitting around it smiling, laughing, discussing, and drinking something warm out of cups.

This image, if it is ever created would show a number of things:  
* Like the abri, Aabriism offers some shelter but requires you to do a bit of work to give yourself complete shelter
* The people are discussing.  This is a key element - on of the central practices.
* The people are using fire and drinking out of cups in the cold night - they are having fun.  They made the night a little better.

For now, I offer an image of the Abri Cro-Magnon
