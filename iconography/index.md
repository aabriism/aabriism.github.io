# Iconography and Music

One of the most lovely things about religion is that the community shares icongraphy and music.  I hope that one day we have some.

The one thing I can see quite clearly in my mind is a picture.  It is a night scene.  There is a large abri (an angled stone cliff face in this case), with a shelter built up next to it.  There is a fire in front of the shelter and people sitting around it smiling, laughing, discussing, and drinking something warm out of cups.

This image, if it is ever created would show a number of things:  
* Like the natural abri, Aabriism offers some shelter but requires you to do a bit of work to give yourself complete shelter
* The people are discussing.  This is a key element - on of the central practices.
* The people are using fire and drinking out of cups in the cold night - they are having fun.  They made the night a little better.

For now, I offer an image of the Abri Cro-Magnon

## Website as Iconography
As a side note, my wife tells me I should make the website a real site - not just a collection of markdown.  I think she just wants it to look "professional" as if that will give it more of a chance to be accepted.   From a marketing point of view she is probably right.  And of course, we all like pretty things, so perhaps one day I will "pretty up" the content, but I doubt that this thing will ever have followers.  I would one day like to get legal recognition as a religion, though, as it would somehow be validating.
